# CMSC-100-Project




**Project Description:**\
Farm to table is an innovative e-commerce website that simulates direct link between consumers and farmers. The project highlights a shop, add to cart, and checkout format where consumers can browse crops and poultry through the website and finalize transactions through checkouts.



**Project Features:**\
As a customer, users can effortlessly navigate through the platform's product listings and manage shopping carts with ease. Customers have the flexibility to delete items from their carts, monitor the total number of items added, and view the accumulated price before proceeding to checkout. Farm to table also offers convenient sorting options for products in the inventory, allowing users to arrange items based on criteria such as name, type, price, or quantity. Managing orders is simplified, enabling users to confirm purchases and, if necessary, cancel orders that have not yet been confirmed by the merchant. The platform prioritizes a seamless and transparent shopping experience for all customers.

On the merchant side, administrators have access to a suite of features designed to streamline store management. They can oversee user accounts, keeping track of registered users and their total count. Merchants can efficiently organize their inventory by sorting products in ascending or descending order based on various parameters. Order fulfillment is straightforward, allowing merchants to confirm customer orders and finalize them for delivery upon confirmation. Additionally, the platform provides comprehensive sales reports, offering insights into products sold, income generated by each product, and total sales.
